iHealthcare-Health At your desk

To address the problem of access to reliable healthcare information, our website is to create an environment that  serves as a trusted source of accurate and up-to-date healthcare information. It will cover a wide range of healthcare topics, including disease information, treatment options, preventive measures, wellness tips, and lifestyle choices. This website will aim to empower individuals by providing them with the knowledge and resources necessary to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

Through our website users will be able to get :-

-24x7 health support Chatbot

-Medical Counselling

-Emergency services

-OPD service

For this project, I have used Azure Services such as Azure Health Bot, Azure Static Web Apps,
